# Create and Manage Cloud Resources: Challenge Lab

## Overview
In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

**Topics tested:**

 - Create an instance
 - Create a 3-node Kubernetes cluster and run a simple service
 - Create an HTTP(s) load balancer in front of two web servers
